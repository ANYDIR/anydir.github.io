#  â‡ŒANYDIR

ANYDIR is a site to store information about DJ Hero and the formats, tools and data within it. We welcome you to submit contributions via pull request!

## Navigating ANYDIR

ANYDIR currently lacks a search bar, so the main way to navigate is either through searching the GitHub repo or through clicking sidebar and category links.

To go to the source file for any page, hit the green Github icon in the corner, from there you can edit pages and send pull requests to edit pages.

Page edits are not immediately noticeable and will only appear once the wiki is rebuilt (Fairly regularly) as it's a static site.
