# DJHTools
DJHTools is an array of scripts and tools made for editting, converting and tweaking DJ Hero files created by Shockdude. DJHTools can be found at the DJHTools Github Repo

## Tools provided
DJHTools contains a wide variety of scripts, mainly converters from proprietary FreeStyleGames formats to formats that can be used by standard editors.

### FSGMUB to CSV
FSGMUB to CSV is a script to extract data from FSGMUB chart files and output them into a text format (CSV). This is usually used for quick editting of files and those that lack the need to run more expansive tools.

### Miscellaneous
DJHTools also contains a variety of tools which are deemed non-crucial to the DJ Hero modding experience. These tools are either experimental, very specific in terms of where to use them or not full documented.

#### FSGMUB to CHART
Early on in the DJ Hero modding scene converting to .chart (Made for Clone Hero and Moonscraper) was an easy entry point for charters experienced with other games, however this has now been mostly superceded by using REAPER instead of Moonscraper for charting.
